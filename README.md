# Hotel-Reservation-System
1st project of the Udacity Java Nanodegree Program

The 1st project for Udacity's Java nanodegree program. A hotel reservation system that runs in a command line interface. Users are able to create an account and search for as well as book available rooms. The system offers new dates when the requested ones are booked. Also has an Admin panel where you can view created accounts, number of rooms, and current bookings as well as the ability to create rooms. I added an extra feature that creates a random number of rooms with random prices and random bed types.
